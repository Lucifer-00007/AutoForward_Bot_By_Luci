## Direction on how to use ".env":-
# "APP_ID" and "API_HASH" - Get it from 'my.telegram.org'
# The "FROM_CHANNEL" and "TO_CHANNEL" are the channel 'ids' not the channel 'usernames' - Get it from '@chnlidbot'
# Do not copy the license into the ".env" file.
# Do not use quotes (") in the values.
